    <p>Letâ€™s start with a little background on Regional Cuisine. It is cuisine 
        based upon national, state or local regions. Regional cuisines may vary 
        based upon food availability, climates, cooking traditions and practices, 
        and cultural differences. Regional cuisines are often named after the 
        geographic areas or regions that they originate from.
