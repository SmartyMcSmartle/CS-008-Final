        <h1>Why we should eat less meat to save the planet</h1>

        <p>The earth’s environment has changed dramatically due to human activity, 
            one of which is altering the earth to raise animals for food. Animal 
            agriculture requires massive amounts of water, energy, food, and water. 
            The earth’s resources are being used up and the air and water are being 
            polluted to meet the demand for meat that people on Earth are consuming. 
            Eating a vegetarian diet can make a difference by not supporting this resource 
            depleting industry.</p>
        
        <p>Around the world, entire ecosystems are being destroyed to create more room 
            for animals as well as crops to feed them. According to the FAO approximately 
            75 percent of the world’s fisheries are either exploited or depleted due to fishing. 
            This will most likely lead to the complete depletion of currently fished fish stocks 
            by 2048. Brazil’s Amazon has hurt terribly due to deforestation to create more space 
            for animal agriculture. The World Bank has found that animal agriculture is responsible 
            for roughly 90 percent of this razing. In the United States, 80 percent of all the 
            agricultural land is used to raise animals for food and grow grain to feed them. 
            This amounts to almost half the total land mass of the lower 48 states[2]. Another 
            extreme issue related to animal agriculture is the consumption of water that this 
            industry requires. It is the number one consumer of fresh water, consuming 55 trillion 
            gallons of water annually. When looking at this issue from a meat eater’s perspective, 
            it takes roughly 5,000 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef [1]. And if the issues 
            of deforestation and overuse of water weren’t extreme enough, the USDA states that 
            global agriculture, which is dominated by livestock production and the grains grown 
            to support it, accounts for 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions [1]. And as the world 
            transitions more and more towards an increased consumption of meat and dairy products, 
            the amount of gas emissions will continue to rise. Clearly, animal agriculture is an an 
            extremely harmful industry as it contributes greatly to negative environment changes.</p>
   
        <p>So how much does eating vegetarian really help the environment if surely not everyone will 
            switch to a vegetarian diet? A reduced demand for meat in a local grocery store sets of a 
            change in the demand chain. Grocery stores do not like to throw away meat and dairy products, 
            so they are extra precise about ordering exactly what they need for the consumers [3]. 
            Eventually, this preference for less meat influences the decision to open up another farm or 
            not if there is a trend towards less meat. By choosing not to participate in this energy 
            intensive industry, a vegetarian is choosing to contribute less to these massive pains on the
            earth. And while many of the statistics above refer to all animal agriculture, so including 
            animals produced for dairy purposes and not for consumption of meat, vegetarianism is still 
            supporting a reduction in animal agriculture.</p>
