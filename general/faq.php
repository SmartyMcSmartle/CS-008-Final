    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>How do I get to the individual recipe pages?</h3>
    <p>You can start by going to the country page that you would like to explore 
        from. All of our available recipies for that country will appear. Click 
        on the recipe image that you are interested in making. This will direct
        you to that specific recipe's page</p>
    <h3>How do I save a recipe?</h3>
    <p>Once you are on the recipe page that you love, you can either copy and 
    paste the recipe into a word document or bookmark it.</p>
    <h3>Can I use your recipes on my website/blog?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, recipes cannot be reproduced or distributed to third parties,
    including other websites for copyright reasons and as per our legal notices.</p>
    <h3>What do I get as a subscriber?</h3>
    <p>As a subscriber to our Regional Recipes email list, you will have unlimited
    access to all the content our website has to offer and monthly updates of new

    <h3>I have a recipe that I think you would be interested in including on the 
    site, how can I send it to you?</h3>
    <p>We are always excited to try new recipes! For that reason, we have included 
    a recipe form to be filled out if you would like to share a recipe with us.
